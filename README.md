# Project: Untitled Survivors (Working Title)

A Unity-powered survival game inspired by **Vampire Survivors**, developed by two longtime friends reconnecting through game development.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is a creative collaboration between **Regg** and **Mark**. It's a team-building and confidence-building experience as we relearn, explore, and ship a full game together using Unity.

The goal: Build a complete core gameplay loop with placeholder visuals, then expand into RPG/progression elements, art, sound, and style as we go.
